# DU-Ore-Finder
Locates ores using a programming board

Original code taken from MathFreak314. https://github.com/MathFreak314/DU-LUA-Ore-Finder
Publishing without his permission because I don't know how to contact him.
Lots of legacy code remains in the script because I'm too lazy to clean it up.


HUD has been overhauled from the original. Mount a Programming Board on your construct. Copy the text from the script file here, and in game right click your programming board and paste the script from clipboard. Activate the board before you go mining, and follow the instructions on your screen.

Once at least 3 distances have been locked in, you will get a waypoint in your chat box. Right click it to set it as your destination. The first waypoint is rarely precise, but keep locking more distances to get a more accurate reading. And don't be afraid to switch over to your detector once you get close.
